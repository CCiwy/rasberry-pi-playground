circuit:
2k-5k ohm resistor
dentify GPIO Pins:

    Identify the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi that you want to use for connecting your LED. Choose a pin and remember its GPIO number.

Connect Raspberry Pi to Breadboard:

    Connect the GPIO pin on the Raspberry Pi to the breadboard. Connect the ground (GND) pin on the Raspberry Pi to the ground rail on the breadboard.

Connect LED to Breadboard:

    Connect the longer leg (anode) of the LED to the GPIO pin on the breadboard through a current-limiting resistor. Connect the shorter leg (cathode) of the LED to the ground rail on the breadboard.
